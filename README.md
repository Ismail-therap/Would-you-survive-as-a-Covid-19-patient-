## Link to run the app:

https://statistician71.shinyapps.io/Covid19SurvivalApp/?_ga=2.137585715.244747320.1640913246-1439103830.1640913246

## Why we need this application?

To know the survival probability of a covid-19 patient we can use this web application. 

## Model and Data:

Random forest model (around 87% accuracy), 112 patient data ! To get the appropriate patient level data is too difficult. I worked on this project on 2020 and the mother data collected from Kaggle. After some preprocessing I used the data in the project for the prediction. 

## Further Improvement:
1. We can use more patient data. 
2. Can try several model to compare and recommend the best one.
